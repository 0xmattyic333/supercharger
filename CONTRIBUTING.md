Hi there! We're thrilled that you'd like to contribute to this project. Your help is essential for keeping it great.

Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct][code-of-conduct]. By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

## Things to consider

### Issues and PRs

If you have suggestions for how this project could be improved, or want to report a bug, open an issue! We'd love all and any contributions. If you have questions, too, we'd love to hear them.

We'd also love PRs. If you're thinking of a large PR, we advise opening up an issue first to talk about it, though! Look at the links below if you're not sure how to open a PR.

### Assigning issues

To speed up the process, we suggest you to ask the project maintainers if someone else is already working on an issue. If you are interested in tackling this issue and the issue is not assigned to someone yet, please ask the project maintainers to assign you to the issue.

### Code style

Before submitting a pull request, please make sure your code is well-formatted and properly indented and commented. Please refer to the rest of the project for a sense of the code style.

### Version control

When working on a new feature or fixing a bug, please make sure you made a separate branch for your changes. Also, please don't submit a pull request that contains multiple unrelated changes; instead, submit multiple pull requests.

### Documentation

When submitting a pull request, please make sure you have included documentation for your changes; if you implemented a change or added a new feature, please make sure you have updated the documentation accordingly.

### All Contributors Badge

We use the [All Contributors CLI](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/cli/usage) to generate a list of all contributors to the project and their contributions. For more information, please see the [All Contributors documentation](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/).

### Some more things to consider

Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted:

- Write and update tests.
- Keep your changes as focused as possible. If there are multiple changes you would like to make that are not dependent upon each other, consider submitting them as separate pull requests.
- Write a [good commit message.](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)

## Example workflow

To demonstrate how you can submit a pull request, please follow the following steps:

### Forking and making changes

1. [Fork][fork] the project on GitHub and clone it locally.
2. Install all dependencies if necessary.
3. Create a new branch for your changes via `git checkout -b <branch-name>`.
   - For example, if you are implementing a new feature, you can create a branch called `<feature-name>`.
4. Make your changes.
5. Update the documentation if necessary.
6. Once you are satisfied with your changes, commit them. For example, `git commit -m "Add <feature-name> feature"`.

### Submitting a pull request

1. Push your changes to the branch you created in step 3.
2. [Submit a pull request.][pr]
   - Please write a short description of your changes and the issue you are addressing (just the issue number is enough).
3. Wait for the pull request to be accepted.

Feel free to contact the project maintainers if you have any questions. Thanks again for your contribution!
