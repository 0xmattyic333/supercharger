# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for contributing to this project! Please read the following guidelines before submitting a pull request - they will help you to make your pull request more likely to be accepted.

## Things to consider

### Assigning issues

To speed up the process, we suggest you to ask the project maintainers if someone else is already working on an issue. If you are interested in tackling this issue and the issue is not assigned to someone yet, please ask the project maintainers to assign you to the issue.

### Code style

Before submitting a pull request, please make sure your code is well-formatted and properly indented and commented. Please refer to the rest of the project for a sense of the code style.

### Bugs and feature requests

Before beginning work on a new feature or bug, please make sure that an issue has been opened for it. This will help us to track the progress of the feature or bug.

### Version control

When working on a new feature or fixing a bug, please make sure you made a separate branch for your changes. Also, please don't submit a pull request that contains multiple unrelated changes; instead, submit multiple pull requests.

### Documentation

When submitting a pull request, please make sure you have included documentation for your changes; if you implemented a change or added a new feature, please make sure you have updated the documentation accordingly.

## Example workflow

To demonstrate how you can submit a pull request, please follow the following steps:

### Forking and making changes

1. Fork the project on GitHub and clone it locally.
2. Install all dependencies if necessary.
3. Create a new branch for your changes via `git checkout -b <branch-name>`.
   - For example, if you are implementing a new feature, you can create a branch called `<feature-name>`.
4. Make your changes.
5. Update the documentation if necessary.
6. Once you are satisfied with your changes, commit them. For example, `git commit -m "Add <feature-name> feature"`.

### Submitting a pull request

1. Push your changes to the branch you created in step 3.
2. Create a new pull request [here](https://github.com/cytronicoder/supercharger/pulls).
   - Please write a short description of your changes and the issue you are addressing (just the issue number is enough).
3. Wait for the pull request to be accepted.

Feel free to contact the project maintainers if you have any questions. Thanks again for your contribution!
