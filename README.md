# Supercharger

Supercharger is a tool for [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com) to manage its repositories on GitHub easily. It is a Github bot that manages pull requests and issues and guides first-time contributors to submitting their first pull request.

**Note: This project is still in development - join the [Alchemy Platform Discord server](https://discord.gg/RbZtCrzWKY) for updates.**
