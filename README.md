# Supercharger

Supercharger is a tool for [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com) to easily manage their repositories on [GitHub](https://github.com/alchemyplatform). It is a Github bot that manages pull requests and issues, as well as guiding first-time contributors to submitting their first pull request.
